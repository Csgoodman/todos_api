# Todo API & TodoList
The Todo API and TodoList application is a single page application that utilizes a JSON API. This application allows you to create add, delete, and mark todo items as finished. Say goodbye to pen and paper...

## Project Details
The purpose of this project was less about functionality and more to dive deeper into different packages, libraries, and frameworks. I utilized and created my own JSON API as well as a number of technologies including: node.js, express, mongoose, jQuery, and mongoDB. The idea of this project came from Colt Steele's Udemy course. It's important to note that this project was built on AWS Cloud9, with certain changes meant to accomodate that environment.
